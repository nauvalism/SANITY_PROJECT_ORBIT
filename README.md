Project for portfolio created by contributing not more than 1 - 2 hours per day. It's a fast-paced action multiplayer game where you pass around curse of explosion to survive.
Be aware that this is a portfolio project, actual production project requires server-side script for writing or (sometimes) reading data from cloud database to ensure data safety and cheat prevention I used some free assets like LeanTween or iTween for projects for graphical polishing purposes, and sometimes i add utility "Smooth Sync" asset for multiplayer polishing features, which is a paid asset, so it's not intended for pirating since this project is not publicly shared Please do not redistribute the content of this project except for hiring purposes / professional skiil assessment Almost every assets i used in this project is a cc0 assets from itch io

# PORTFOLIO PROJECT ORBIT
 
 The build of this project is available on : https://itsnauornever.itch.io/orbit-in-a-bit
 
 Project for portfolio created by contributing not more than 1 - 2 hours per day. It's a hypercasual 1-input game where you have to rescue astronauts trapped in an orbit of a planet avoiding it's obstacle.

 **Be aware that this is a portfolio project, actual production project requires server-side script for writing or (sometimes) reading data from cloud database to ensure data safety and cheat prevention**
 **I used some free assets like LeanTween or iTween for projects for graphical polishing purposes, and sometimes i add utility "Smooth Sync" asset for multiplayer polishing features, which is a paid asset, so it's not intended for pirating since this project is not publicly shared**
 **Please do not redistribute the content of this project except for hiring purposes / professional skiil assessment**
 **Almost every assets i used in this project is a cc0 assets from itch io**
